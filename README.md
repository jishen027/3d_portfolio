# 3D portfolio project(Three.js and React.js)

This project is a 3D portfolio project that I created using Three.js and React.js. The project is a 3D portfolio that showcases my projects and skills in a 3D environment. The project is built using React.js for the front-end and Three.js for the 3D rendering. The project is a single-page application that allows users to navigate through the 3D environment using the mouse.
